      <h1>Jenkins on the Ice</h1>
      <p>
        Dennis Jenkins, the retired NBA star, made an announcement today,
        revealing his contract with Long Sleep for cryonics. He intends to have
        his body frozen before death and brought back to life in the future once
        medical science has discovered a cure for aging.
      </p>
      <p>
        In his typically entertaining manner, Jenkins explained, "Many
        individuals opt for cryonics to combat illnesses like cancer, but my
        ultimate desire is to be revived when they can restore my eternal
        youth." [sic] Additionally, Jenkins may also be hopeful that medical
        science can address his declining free-throw shooting, which reached 47%
        during his final year in the league.
      </p>
      <p>
        A reader has informed us that Jenkins might not be fully aware that the
        Long Sleep process involves removing the head, preserving only the brain
        for revival. This could pose a challenge for Jenkins as he would be left
        without his least-valued asset.
